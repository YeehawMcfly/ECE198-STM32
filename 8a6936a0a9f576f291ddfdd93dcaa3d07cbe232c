We added our Encrypt and Decrypt functions here for the first time.

The implemented encryption and decryption functions were based on the TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm). It worked by taking plaintext and a key, then applying bitwise operations (shifting, addition, and XOR) iteratively to produce ciphertext. Similarly, the decryption function reverses this process to recover the plaintext. We did these in 2 different functions for modularity.
